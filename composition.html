        <div class="ResponsiveColor">
        <h4 class="text5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Ryan Dave Simon. I am 19 years old. I have only one sibling and I am the eldest.
				We are the second family of my father and I have four brothers in my father’s first family.
				We are close to each other and we are considered real siblings even though we are not the same mother.
				I was always mature of my age. Even my own friends often annoyed me during my adolescent years.
				I have a lot of friends who invested in me, and I excelled at most of my varied hobbies.
				Playing online games has become my hobby and I became interested in playing instruments like guitar, ukulele and kalimba.
				I have been inspired on playing instrument in my half-brother because he is composing songs and I want to become like him.<br><br>
			
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was senior high school I want to take a Humms strand because my dream job is to be a police officer but
				the strand I want was ran out of slots. So I decided to take an ICT strand. I was hesitant because I have no confidence
				on myself and I don’t have laptop that can I use it before. Then in grade 12 as an ICT student we need to take a NC 2 certificate.
				On the day of the assessment I was so nervous and I was overthinking, like I might not finish it on time and I might not get the
				certificate. But thanks god because I passed the National Service Training.  And now I am in college I began to tire of the pressure
				placed on me by my family and their expectations on me. I am afraid that I might fail on one subject. That’s always what I think.
				I am always overthinking.<br><br>
		
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have challenges in my life. One of challenges I face in my life is my father, he got sick while he was in abroad,
				and we are worried because he will have surgery. But thank god the doctor said that his surgery is not continue and
				he is recovered now. The second challenge I face is I fail on two major subjects in first year. I’m so disappointed at myself,
				I blame myself, I even  thought  I was so stupid so I didn’t  pass this two subjects. I don’t know how I can tell to my parents
				that I had failed. Especially to my father I was so embarrassed on him.  I told my mother that I had failed.
				I thought she would be get mad but I don’t expect what she said “It’s okay son, it’s a part of college life just compensate
				on 2nd year”. On that challenge in my life I lost confidence in myself. And sometimes it comes to my mind that
				I can’t study anymore. But I thought more my father’ hardship on our family.</h4><br>
